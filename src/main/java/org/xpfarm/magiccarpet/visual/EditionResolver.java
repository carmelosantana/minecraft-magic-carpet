/**
 * Tells whether a {@link Player} is connected through Floodgate (a Bedrock player behind
 * Geyser) so {@code CarpetVisual} can show the right entity to the right client.
 *
 * <p>Floodgate is a <em>soft</em> dependency: it is never on this plugin's compile classpath
 * and its class must never be linked when the plugin is absent from the server. This class
 * therefore checks {@code Bukkit.getPluginManager().isPluginEnabled("floodgate")} exactly once,
 * at construction, and only then reaches for Floodgate's API via {@link Class#forName}. Any
 * failure anywhere in that chain - the plugin absent, the class missing, the expected method
 * missing, a reflective invocation failure - resolves every player to Java edition.
