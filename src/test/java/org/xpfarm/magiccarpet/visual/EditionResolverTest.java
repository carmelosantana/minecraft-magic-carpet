/**
 * Covers only the parts of {@link EditionResolver} reachable without a running Bukkit server.
 *
 * <p>{@link EditionResolver#create(java.util.logging.Logger)} calls
 * {@code Bukkit.getPluginManager()}, which needs a running server, so it is not exercised here.
 * {@link EditionResolver#attemptLink(java.util.logging.Logger)} does not touch Bukkit at all -
 * it is pure reflection against Floodgate's API class - and this module has no Floodgate
 * dependency on its test classpath, so the "Floodgate absent" failure path is exercised for
 * real rather than simulated. {@link EditionResolver#isBedrock(org.bukkit.entity.Player)} on an
 * {@link EditionResolver#alwaysJava()} instance never dereferences its {@code Player} argument,
 * so it is callable with {@code null} without needing a real player.
